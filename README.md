## SEO & Social Media Optimization

The theme includes the following optimizations for better visibility and sharing:

### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

*   **Dynamic Title Tags:** Title tags are dynamically generated based on the page type (homepage, post page, archive page) to provide clear and concise titles for search engines and users.
*   **Intelligent Meta Descriptions:** Meta descriptions are tailored for each page type, utilizing post snippets for articles and blog descriptions for other pages, enhancing click-through rates from search results.
*   **Removal of Outdated Meta Keywords:** To adhere to modern SEO practices, the deprecated `meta-keywords` tag has been removed.

### Structured Data (Schema.org)

*   **Article Schema:** Individual blog posts are marked up with `Article` schema, providing search engines with details such as headline, author, publication date, modification date, and featured image.
*   **BreadcrumbList Schema:** Breadcrumb navigation is enhanced with `BreadcrumbList` schema, improving navigation context for users and helping search engines understand your site's hierarchy.

### Social Media Sharing

*   **OpenGraph Tags (Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.):** Comprehensive OpenGraph meta tags are implemented to control how your content appears on Facebook, LinkedIn, and other platforms that utilize the OpenGraph protocol. This includes `og:type`, `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:url`, and `og:image`.
*   **Twitter Card Tags (Twitter/X):** Dedicated Twitter Card meta tags (`twitter:card`, `twitter:site`, `twitter:creator`, `twitter:title`, `twitter:description`, `twitter:image`) ensure visually appealing and informative snippets when your content is shared on Twitter/X.
